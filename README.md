# Visit Chihuahua

The goal of this project was to apply all the previous knowledge learned like the box model, flexboxes, grids, media queries and bootstrap while also being provided a real webpage requirement by a fictional client, we receive the general model of how the client wants it and its our work to turn it into reality with our own twist/thematic applied to it. In my case I decided to create a monument finder in my state (Chihuahua, Mexico) so people can search for a certain monument and reserve a personal tour in no time.
